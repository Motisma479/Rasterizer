# Rasterizer

Rasterizer is a project about graphic pipelines and many other stuff about rasterization.

## Installation

```bash
make-j
```

## Run

```bash
./Rasterizer
```

## Usage

```python
-> Resize frame width and frame height
-> Reset Buttons for each features that deals with positions

-> Switch between diffuse and ambient light (diffuse not working but should be in theory)
-> diffuse and light alpha as well as diffuse position can be changed.

-> Switch between different Shapes (Triangle, Square, Cube, Sphere, All shapes, and Textured Cube Shape)
-> You can switch between color spectrum or uniformed static color (refer to "Shape's name" Type)
-> You can choose the shape color "(refer to Shape Color)"
-> You can rotate the shape on three axis (x,y,z) using matrix "(refer to Rotation)"
-> You can move the shape on three axis (x,y,z) using matrix "(refer to Translation)"
-> You can change the shape scale "(refer to Scale)"

-> Information displayed about Camera Position on three axis (x,y,z)
-> Information displayed about Camera Orientation on three axis (x,y,z)
